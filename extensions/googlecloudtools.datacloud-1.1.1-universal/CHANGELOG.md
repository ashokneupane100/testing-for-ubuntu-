    *   **Antigravity CLI Onboarding:** Added a configuration tab for the
        Antigravity CLI to the MCP Onboarding Webview.
    *   **MCP Config Controls:** Improved MCP configuration UI robustness,
        fixing view resetting issues and adding safety checks to disable "Back
        to Simple View" in mixed configurations.
    *   **Antigravity IDE Skill Management:** Adjusted the installation path for
        skills for the Antigravity IDE to ensure they are stored in the specific
        directory required for the IDE to recognize and load them correctly.

## Version 0.3.0 (May 2026)

### New Features & Enhancements

*   **Cloud Storage (GCS) & Apache Spark Integration**

    *   **Load in Spark DataFrame:** Added a new command in the GCS explorer to
        load selected files (.csv, .parquet, .json, and .orc) directly into a
        Spark DataFrame via Spark notebooks.
    *   **Avro File Support:** Added support for opening GCS Avro files in Spark
        notebooks, which automatically generates the setup code to install the
        `spark-avro` package and configures the Spark session.
    *   **GCS Hierarchical Namespace (HNS):** Added support for buckets with HNS
        enabled. The GCS explorer now uses the native GCS Folders API to support
        folder creation and native folder listing.

*   **Dataplex & BigQuery Explorer**

    *   **Business Terms in Schema:** Added a "Business Terms" column to the
        BigQuery schema table in the Dataplex webview, which displays attached
        aspects and associated business terms for each schema field.
    *   **Copy SQL Button:** Added a copy button in the Dataplex Insights SQL
        editor allowing users to copy the displayed SQL query to their
        clipboard, accompanied by a toast notification.
    *   **Relationship Graph Banner:** Added an informational banner to the
        Relationship Graph clarifying that the graph is based on entry-links and
        directing users to BigQuery Studio for DataScan job results.
    *   **Saved Queries File Extension:** Updated the BigQuery explorer to
        display saved queries with a `.sql` extension and a file icon to improve
        visual consistency.

*   **"Reveal in Tree" Navigation**

    *   Standardized parent path routing and ensured resources (AlloyDB,
        Spanner, Cloud SQL) are correctly revealed under unpinned explorer
        views, resolving UI race conditions and crashes.

### Bug Fixes & UX Improvements

*   **Navigation & Explorer Usability**

    *   **Serverless Runtime Form:** Adjusted the "Back" button behavior when
        editing serverless runtimes. It now correctly returns to the template
        details view instead of resetting the form.
    *   **Saved Queries:** Fixed a bug that prevented saved queries from
        successfully opening in the editor.

### Configuration & Documentation

*   **Extension Configuration:** Automated MCP configuration updates when using
    the extension, ensuring notebooks and visualization MCP servers are
    correctly installed and updated.
*   **Documentation:** Added Dataflow to the list of supported services in the
    README and added new user documentation for Dataflow.
